It and the innovations that it entails can establish a new world that may now seem like a path of imagination, but current signs confirm that the creation of this world is imminent. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has become accustomed to not waiting for the future, but rather entering into it, competing on its technologies, anticipating its challenges, and developing successful solutions to them



## The Fourth Industrial Revolution

The Fourth Industrial Revolution was based on the foundations and rules of the Third Industrial Revolution, represented by the development of computer technology and the Internet, and depends on linking and integrating the physical or material sciences with digital and biological systems in manufacturing processes, or in other words, they are electronically controlled machine systems, that is, smart machines connected to the Internet.The beginning of the Fourth Industrial Revolution at the beginning of the **21st** century was based on the digital revolution, the mobile Internet, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, digital technologies and smart systems, autonomous vehicles, nanotechnology and biotechnology, materials science and energy storage, quantum computing, and automated border guards. Computers are so ingenious that they can write stories and rival the imagination of novelists.

## Among the most important positives of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are:
 1. Achieving high rates of economic, social and humanitarian development. 
 2. Improving and raising the level of human health care. 
 3. Save a lot of time in the development process, and disseminate its achievements to the world. 
 4. Reducing the cost of production and providing highly efficient services and means of transportation and communication at a lower price.



## Among the most important negatives of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are:
 1. The dominance of large companies over industrial production and the decline of the role of medium and small companies.
  2. The widening scope of unemployment, as the automation of industry and rapid technological development would reduce job opportunities by 50%, affecting the middle and lower groups or those with “simple jobs” that do not require high scientific and technical expertise. 
  3. It imposes unprecedented challenges on human societies, examples of which include the following: the realization of inequality and the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.



## Fields and applications of artificial intelligence
 Artificial intelligence is used in many military, industrial, economic, technical, medical, educational, and other service fields. Among its most important applications are: self-driving cars and drones. A robot is a mechanical device programmed to work independently of human control, and is designed to perform tasks and accomplish human motor and verbal skills, in addition to its many other uses in nuclear reactors, extending wires, repairing underground wire installations, detecting mines, the automobile industry, and other precise fields. Nonlinear control, such as railway control, is smart devices capable of performing mental operations such as examining industrial designs, monitoring processes, and making decisions. Cognitive simulation using computers to test theories about how the human mind works and the functions it performs, such as recognizing familiar faces and voices or recognizing handwriting, processing images, extracting useful data and information from them, and activating memory. Computer applications in medical diagnosis in clinics and hospitals and performing surgical operations. Artificial intelligence programs in analyzing economic data, such as the stock market and developing stock trading systems. Game programs, such as chess games and video games.

## Robots and smart services are the most prominent areas of artificial intelligence
After all, artificial intelligence is one of the types of modern science that has spread widely recently, and it has entered many industrial and research fields, most notably robots and smart services for governments and companies. Artificial intelligence is known as one of the branches of computer science, and it is the behavior and characteristics on which various computer programs depend, and are consistent with human mental capabilities in various works, and one of the most important of these capabilities is the machine’s ability to teach and make correct decisions, and artificial intelligence acquires information through practical practices. It is also able to distinguish between multiple issues accurately, and one of the most important capabilities of artificial intelligence is its response to changes and its flexibility and speed of reaction in all situations. Artificial intelligence has the ability to sense perception. Thus, making decisions correctly, based on studying all possibilities and mastering their results, and then choosing the best decisions that lead to the desired results. It can be said that artificial intelligence began with the development of some different computer programs, most notably chess programs, when the scientist Claude Shannon drew An algorithm that qualifies the computer to play chess and predict all the possibilities of the other player's move. Artificial intelligence is included in all technical fields that require logical thinking, knowledge, planning, and virtual perception based on applying theories and choosing the correct solutions.

# Motives for the Kingdom’s direction to activate artificial intelligence

Based on the wise leadership’s keenness to achieve precedence and leadership in all areas of development, it has become accustomed not to waiting for the future, but rather to entering into it, competing for its technologies, anticipating its challenges, and developing effective solutions for them. This explains the state’s relentless trend towards the technologies of the fourth generation of the industrial revolution, which is represented by artificial intelligence. Which is considered the one that is inevitable from understanding its ABCs and eliminating illiteracy in it, based on the dependence of health and education, the language of the future, and other vital services and sectors on it. Hence, the state turned to developing specialized scientific competencies and local capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence, organizing specialized training courses for government employees in data science, and creating a culture of artificial intelligence among segments of society to facilitate the spread of the use of applications that rely on these technologies and create a digital citizen capable of dealing with them. Through concerted efforts between governmental, educational and media institutions to raise community awareness of the basics of this field, with the establishment of research centers that contribute to developing the various sectors in the country and qualifying them to receive the necessities of artificial intelligence.

## World Summit on Artificial Intelligence
The World Summit on Artificial Intelligence, organized by the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA), was held on October 21-22, 2020, as it was a prominent global platform that brought together decision-makers, experts, specialists and academics in the government and private sectors from various parts of the world, including leading technology companies. And investors. And businessmen, under the slogan “Artificial Intelligence for the Good of Humanity.” The summit was a unique opportunity to explore what the new global landscape for artificial intelligence means, the potential for best using artificial intelligence to build a better future for all, and the implications for decision-makers interested in taking advantage of that potential for the good of humanity. It was not surprising that during the World Summit on Artificial Intelligence, His Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called on all dreamers in the world to join the Kingdom, which seeks to be a center and incubator for artificial intelligence. His Highness highlighted the great importance of artificial intelligence to keep pace with future challenges, especially since the summit coincided with the Corona pandemic, which revealed the importance of supporting digital transformation in various industrial and production fields. His Highness the Crown Prince’s sponsorship of this global summit is in line with the interest that His Highness gives to this field, especially since it is considered a pillar in the transition towards achieving Vision 2030.
